## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?

Git is a software to do version control, tracking changes in a 
file or set of files. 

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

While we use git keep track on changes to files we use github to store git 
repositories in the cloud

3. Why do we create a branch?

To create another line of development for a project without affecting the 
main code.
 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?

A pull request compares changes made to a code on different branches 

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.

Git checkout

6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?

Git fetch downloads commits from remote repository without merging with local files. Git pull downloads commits from remote repository and merges them with 
your local files. Git merge can be used to incorporate changes from another repository or to merge 2 branches

7. What is a merge conflict?

It happens with git can't resolve automatically a difference betweeen two commits. 

8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

After identifying the commits that are causing the confflict, we should edit the file, 
make the necessary changes, create a new commit and finally complete the merge.
